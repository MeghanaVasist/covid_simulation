# Covid Simulation using Mesa
The Jupyter Notebook is given as simulation.ipynb  
The code is written in Python==3.7.1

### Libraries used:
Mesa  
numpy  
random  
matplotlib.pyplot  

This assignment contains three main tasks:  
Task 1: Basic implementation  
Task 2: Introduce quarantine center  
Task 3: Introduce social distancing with quarantine center  

## Implementation:
Two classes:  
    1. Model class called SocietyModel. Contains three methods: __init__(), get_infections(), step()  
    2. Agent class called SocietyAgent. Contains five methods: __init__(), move(), change_status(), infect(), step()  

## Execution
1. Download the simulation.ipynb file  
2. Open this file in Jupyter Notebook and click on Cells -> Run All  

**NOTE:** The submitted notebook contains the graphs that were generated on the last run of the code.

## Report and analysis:
All the observations and graphs are added in the report names as report.pdf.
